# LibraryManagementSystem

## Key Objectives
- **Implement a comprehensive library management system.**
- **Apply object-oriented programming principles** for flexible and scalable code.
- **Utilize essential data structures** to optimize library operations.
- **Design and implement a normalized database schema.**
- **Develop SQL skills** for efficient database manipulation.

## Description
The **Advanced Library Management System** project aims to provide a comprehensive learning experience in various areas of software development, including:

1. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Leveraging inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation to create a modular and maintainable codebase.
2. **Data Structures**: Employing linked lists, stacks, and queues to manage library resources and transactions effectively.
3. **Database Design**: Developing a normalized database schema to ensure data consistency and minimize redundancy.
4. **SQL Skills**: Writing efficient SQL queries for database creation, manipulation, and data retrieval.
5. **JDBC Utilization**: Establishing secure connections with the database and executing SQL operations programmatically.

Participants will build a sophisticated library management system that incorporates these concepts to efficiently manage library resources and operations.

## User Interface
The project includes a **JavaFX**-based user-friendly interface, which features:
- **Forms** for data input (e.g., adding books, patron details).
- **Tables** for displaying information (e.g., borrowed books, penalties).
- **Buttons** for executing actions (e.g., borrowing or returning books).

This interface enhances usability by providing an intuitive platform for library administrators and patrons to interact with the system.
